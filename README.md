### Development
#### Getting started
Open up your terminal and navigate to the directory of your choice. Clone the repository and install its dependencies.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jaredpalmer/react-email-workflow.git MyEmailApp
cd MyEmailApp
npm install
```
In order to get webscraping to work, you'll need an Embedly account and an API key.
Then create a `.env` file in your root directory as follows.
```bash
# .env
EMBEDLY=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX   # Embedly API Key
```
#### Run in development mode
Open your `Procfile`. Comment out the first line and replace and add a second line as follows.
```bash
# web: npm run build && npm run start:prod  # production
web: npm run start # dev
```
Enter the following command in your terminal:
```bash
heroku local
```
This will start an Express server with Webpack Dev + Hot Middleware and React Hot Loader at `localhost:5000`. It will watch for changes on the frontend.

##### Styles
When you examine the codebase you'll notice a lack of CSS files. All styling is done through jsxstyle. I encourage you read up on the documentation. 95% of the time, jsxstyle is fantastic. However, due to a lack of psuedo selectors, certain things can get annoying...like hover states. Included are some helper classes like `<HoverRegion/>` and `<Button>` to help you out.

#### Run in production mode
Open your `Procfile` and comment out the development line, but now uncomment the production line:
```bash
web: npm run build && npm run start:prod  # production
```
This will compile the frontend and start an express server in production mode.
Open a browser to `localhost:5000`.

### Deployment
You can deploy REW to Heroku. This config supports Heroku's new pipeline + Github integration.
